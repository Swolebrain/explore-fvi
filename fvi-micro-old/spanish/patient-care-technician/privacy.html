<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISCLAIMER</span></strong></p>



<p>Florida Vocational Institute makes no representation or warranty regarding the accuracy of the information contained on this site.  You understand and agree that under no circumstance will Florida Vocational Institute be responsible nor liable in any way and to any degree for any claims, costs, losses, expenses or damages howsoever arising whether direct, indirect or consequential in respect of any omissions or consequences of actions taken by Users based on any information, opinions or advice contained within this Website or as a result of the actions of third parties acting without authority from Florida Vocational Institute.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDEMNITY</span></strong></p>



<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Florida Vocational Institute and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees, harmless from and against any suit, action, claim, demand, penalty or loss, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by or resulting from any third party due to or arising out of Your use of the website, breach of this Agreement or the materials it incorporates by reference, or Your violation of any law, regulation, order or other legal mandate, or the rights of a third party.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GOVERNING LAW</span></strong></p>



<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions and as if this Agreement was a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Florida.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></strong><strong>.</strong></p>




<p>If a claim or controversy arises between You and Florida Vocational Institute (individual, a <strong>“Party”</strong>, and collectively, the <strong>“Parties”</strong>) which is not based on a failure to pay moneys due for the subscription service, the authorized representatives of the Parties shall meet within thirty (30) days thereafter to review and discuss such claim or controversy and attempt, in good faith, to settle or resolve the matter.  If the dispute cannot be resolved by the Parties’ authorized representatives, it shall be submitted to mediation within the next thirty (30) days, with a mediator agreed-to by the Parties, as a condition precedent to any claim in any judicial or other dispute resolution process.  If the Parties cannot agree on a mediator, Florida Vocational Institute will randomly select a mediator.  The mediation shall take place at Florida Vocational Institute. If the dispute cannot be resolved by the Parties’ authorized representatives through mediation, the parties agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration which shall take place at Florida Vocational Institute and be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The Parties shall select a single arbitrator. If the Parties cannot agree to the arbitrator, then an arbitrator located in Miami-Dade County, Florida will be selected by the AAA.  A judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The award of the arbitrators shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion.  The opinion shall set forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The award shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators’ and administrative fees of arbitration.  Failure of a Party to pay fees due in the arbitration will constitute a breach of this agreement enforceable before a court of law of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrators shall award to the prevailing Party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, all of its costs and fees. “Costs and fees” mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys’ fees.  The arbitrators will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing Party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute.  The award shall be made within nine months of the filing of the notice of intention to arbitrate (demand), and the arbitrator(s) shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by agreement of the Parties or by the arbitrator(s) if necessary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek preliminary injunctive relief with any Federal District Court of competent jurisdiction.  In the event of an action for preliminary injunctive relief under this Agreement, Florida Vocational Institute will be entitled to emergency injunctive relief without bond.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MISCELLANEOUS</span></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter herein. You may not assign this Agreement, or assign, transfer or sublicense Your rights under the Agreement. A failure to act with respect to a breach by You or others does not waive Florida Vocational Institute's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. In the event that any provision or any portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement (and the balance of any provisions held void or unenforceable in part only) shall continue in full force and effect. All rights and responsibilities set forth in this term and condition are transferable by Florida Vocational Institute at its sole discretion.  You will remain bound to these terms and conditions notwithstanding such transfer or any change in ownership or structure of Florida Vocational Institute.</p>
